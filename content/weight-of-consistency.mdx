**People overestimate intensity and underestimate consistency.**

> Consistency is the weight you lift every single day, even when no one is watching.  
> It’s boring. It’s repetitive. It feels too small to matter.  
> But the truth is — every rep stacks. Every page read compounds. Every line of code written sharpens you.  
> Intensity gives you sparks, but consistency forges the fire.  
> Without it, you’ll always start strong and finish weak.

*A man who masters consistency doesn’t need motivation — he becomes the proof of momentum itself.*
